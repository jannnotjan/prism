# PixelPrism

PixelPrism is a fork of the original `Transparent-Pixel-Fix` project by Corecii, it's an image processing utility designed to help you remove dark outlines on resized images that feature transparent edges.


Think of PP as a prism for your pixels, analyses the colour data from neighbouring pixels, and conveys it further, elliminating the "halo" effect where possible.
> In most cases PP removes most, if not all, of the black pixels, but in some cases it might fail and "halo" effects might be visible to some extent.
